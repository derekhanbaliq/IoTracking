1. based on A9 Reference Bootloader:

BT:
if flag==0, then do nothing
if flag==1, which is you find FlagA.txt and delete FlagA.txt, then update iotrackingTestCode.bin, be careful about BOOT_TEST in main21.c, don't go in while(1), but to go the later start etc. 
if flag==2, ...

OTA:
input CLI fw, then it download FlagA.txt, and auto reset to go through BT to update firmware



2. based on A11 current BT:

don't use BT

OTA also seems to be useless..
